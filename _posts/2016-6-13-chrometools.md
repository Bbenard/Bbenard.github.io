title: Chrome Development Tools
---
 *Introduction*
 
  Google Chrome is a rich and powerful web browser, pioneering what is possible for applications on the web. Google has worked hard to deliver a very fast, very stable, feature rich browsing experience for end users. Google has also ensured that developers like you have a great experience with Chrome. The Developer Tools, bundled and available in Chrome and 
  Safari, allows web developers and programmers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application.
  
 *Overview*
 
 Overall, there are eight main groups of tools available view Developer Tools, and the capabilities are being extended with every release. Chrome 5 now offers Elements, Resources, Scripts, Timeline, Profiles, Storage, Audits, and Console.
 *Elements*
 
 The Elements tool allows you to see the web page as the browser sees it. That is, using the Elements tool, you can see the raw HTML, raw CSS styles, the Document Object Model, and manipulate either in real time.
 
 *Resources*
 
 Use the Resources tool to learn what components your web page or application is requesting from web servers, how long these requests take, and how much bandwidth is required. You can also view the HTTP request and response headers for each of your resources. The Resources tool is perfect for helping you speed up page load times. 
 
 *Scripts*
 
 To peer inside the JavaScript for a page, you will use the Scripts tool. Here you can find a list of scripts required by the page plus a full featured script debugger. You can even change the JavaScript on the fly! Read more in Part Two, coming soon.
 
 *Timeline*
 
 For advanced timing and speed analysis, the Timeline tool offers in-depth visibility into the various Chrome behind-the-scenes activities. You can learn how long the browser takes to handle DOM events, rendering page layouts, and paint the window.
 
*Profiles*

The Profiles tool helps you capture and analyze the performance of JavaScript scripts. For example, you can learn which functions take the most time to execute and zero in on exactly where to optimize

*Storage*

Modern web applications require more persistence than simply cookies, and the Storage tool helps you track, query, and debug local browser storage. This tool can display and query data stored in local databases, local storage, session storage, and cookies.
